# 🎉 NC Birthday App

This **NC Birthday App** is an app that allows users to view the current month's and day's birthday celebrants, as well as allow them to leave anonymous messages for the current day's celebrant for them to guess _(which I think is the fun part!)_.

I have currently restricted this app for Northcoder employees use, hence a couple of restrictions are put in place. But feel free to browse the code.

## 🛠 Tools Used

The goal of building this app is for me to practice the implementation of Google Firebase services such as Authentication, Storage, and Realtime Database.
